# Animation Part 2

## Summary

In the last article, I illustrated a very simple mechanism for animating sprites. In this article, I'm going to expand on that a little and try to develop a system that isn't quite so dependant of the `al_wait_for_event_until` function.

## What is FPS?

FPS (Frames Per Second) is a standard way of determining the 'quality' of animation; more animation frames per second == smoother animation. We've seen what that looks like in our last example, by simply 'pausing' our application for a specific set of time. But that's not really a great way to do it. Why?

Here's the thing, each iteration through the main loop of our program might not take the exact same amount of time, depending on the workload we have running under the hood. So that pause we have via the `al_wait_for_event_until` is a fixed amount of time, but everything else can vary.

So, on one loop, we may take .01 seconds to process, but on the next, it may take .2 seconds. The original pause via the `al_wait_for_event_until` was set to 0.06 seconds, so we now have loops taking 0.07 and 0.09 seconds. Thus the animation may 'judder' over time; we end up holding a frame of animation too long.

To correct this, we need to determine the time between frames; and only advance our movement / animations based on the time that has elapsed between frames.
