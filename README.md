# Spaced Invaders - A C/C++ Programming Tutorial Series

## Rationale

For many, many years I've wanted to put together a tutorial in programming languages that would be appropriate for all ages and disciplines. It's bothered me that there haven't been any 'accessible' tutorials out there; tutorials that go from zero to competency in a way that _everyone_ can understand. But that's a really hard problem to try and get right.

So I thougth I'd throw my hat into the ring on this one.

What we're going to build over the course of this series is a functional (but not necessarily complete) Space Invaders clone. I chose this becase:

a) I'm a game developer by day. Write what you know.
b) There's a buttload of source material that people can reference
c) Gameplay logic is trivial.
d) It allows, at an incredibly low fidelity, us to cover a great deal of ground.

## The Method

I'm going to be using a mix of technologies for this.

- Visual Studio Community 2017 : for our C++ editing needs
- C++ Shell : For quick and easy C/C++ explainations.
- Allegro : A library that covers the majority of our media needs.
- GitHub : Some place to put all this stuff
- Markdown : How to document all this.
- Google Classroom : Possibly a way to create conversations about topics.
- Krita and The Gimp : Image editing

I'm also going to be writing in a very informal manner. I write like I talk. I'll be doing a lot of edits as I build out this documentation, so you may want to re-read sections (I'll call them out as I edit them).

## So why not just grab a book/take a class?

This is, by no stretch of the imagination, meant to replace formal classes, other books or other material. I encourage reading and experimenting as much as possible. This is meant as a supplement to other materials. I will try not to gloss over topics, but if there are better resources for explaining the material, I will be (gladly) referring to them.

The other aspect of this is that I want anyone who's reading this to feel engaged. If there are any questions, or suggestions, I'd like to be able to accomdate them as much as possible. Education is a two way street. But also respect that I can only do so much in my spare time ;)

## Sylabus (did I spell that right?)

I'll be building this out as I go:

- Introduction (You're currently here)
- [Basic Concepts](basicconcepts.md)
- [Your First Local Program](firststeps.md)
- [Something you can compile on your own machine](firststeps.md)
