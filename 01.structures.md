# Complex Data Types

#Overview

At this point, the types that you've seen are fairly rudimentary. They consist of one 'thing'; a floating point number, a boolean value, an integer value.

But you can also have 'complex' or 'structured' data types.

Let's say we wanted to be able to represent a point in 2D cartesean space. That has an X and a Y component.  You could do something like this, every time you wanted to represent a 2D point:

``` C++
float playerX;
float playerY;
```

Now let's create the position for an enemy.

``` C++
float enemyX;
float enemyY;
```

or, we wanted to create 5 enemies ...

``` C++
float redEnemyX;
float redEnemyY;

float blueEnemyX;
float blueEnemyY;

float greenEnemyX;
float greenEnemyY;

float yellowEnemyX;
float yellowEnemyY;

float orangeEnemyX;
float orangeEnemyY;
```

That is a lot of variables. And it was a bugger to type all that. And I made a lot of mistakes typing them out.

And each of those points shared the same thing, a float that represented the X and Y positions. Wouldn't it have been easier to have a 'structured' data type that created a cookie cutter outline for that?  It sure does, and that's where the `struct` keyword comes into play.

``` C++
#include <stdio.h>

struct Point2D
{
    float X;
    float Y;
};

int main()
{
    Point2D player;

    Point2D redEnemy;
    Point2D blueEnemy;
    Point2D greenEnemy;
    Point2D yellowEnemy;
    Point2D orangeEnemy;

    player.X = 0.0f;
    player.Y = 0.0f;

    redEnemy.X = 10.0f;
    redEnemy.Y = -10.0f;

    printf("player position: [%f,%f]\n", player.X, player.Y);
    printf("redEnemy position: [%f, %f]\n", redEnemy.X, redEnemy.Y);

    return 0;
}
```

```
player position: [0.000000,0.000000]
redEnemy position: [10.000000, -10.000000]
```

If you look at how we defined the struct, it kind of looks like a funtion. The struct has a body (everything between the curly braces), and it has a name `Point2D`. But that's where the similarities end. There is no return type, there are no agruments.

You create a variable of this type like you would any other variable. But to access its 'fields', you need that `.` operator. What you're doing there is accessing a specific part of the structure, rather than the whole thing. That's really useful, because you can now pass that structure around, rather than passing around the fundamental data types.

For example, let's do something like calculate the distance between two points
