# Arrays and Graphics

## Overview

In this next article, we introduce the concept of _arrays_, their use and how they relate to memory.

At the end of this article, you should have some graphics on the screen that move. Overall, this should be a more interesting article than in the past.

## What is an array

We've all seen them. It's a collection of 'like' stuff. Wikipedia defines an array as:

> An array is a systematic arrangement of similar objects, usually in rows and columns.

## Real world examples of arrays

![Real World Arrays](images/realworldarrays.png)

Arrays in programming are pretty much a unified collection of 'like' objects. You can have an array of `int`s, `float`s, `bool`s, or even your own structs. You can also have arrays of pointers too!

What does that look like in C/C++?

``` C++
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    // an integer array with 5 elements
    int values[5];

    // a float array with 10 elements;
    float temperatures[10];

    // a boolean array with 20 elements
    bool somethingElse[20];

    // an example of setting the values in each element
    values[0] = 1;
    values[1] = 2;
    values[2] = 3;
    values[3] = 4;
    values[4] = 5;

    for (int index = 0; index < 5; index++)
    {
        printf("element at index %d is %d\n", index, values[index]);
    }
}
```

This resuls in:

``` Prompt
gcc version 4.6.3
   
element at index 0 is 1
element at index 1 is 2
element at index 2 is 3
element at index 3 is 4
element at index 4 is 5
```

We've defined 3 arrays now: `values`, `temperatures` and `somethingElse`.

Breaking down the syntax of each array declaration:

| type | variable name |   | How big an array to make | | |
| ---- |:-------------:| - |:------------------------:|-|-|
| int  | values        | [ | 5 | ] | ; |
| float | temperatures | [ | 10 | ] | ; |
| bool | somethingElse | [ | 20 | ] | ; |


To review, from the code example:

- declare a variable like you would normally
- we define how lart the array is by taking the number of elements we want and wrapping it in `[` `]`
- ALL ARRAYS ARE INDEXED FROM THE 0 ELEMENT!
    - I can't stress this enough - in C++ the first element of any array is the `0` element.
- If you try to access beyond the length of the array, you _will_ get undefined behaviour.

On that last point, you can see it for yourself. Anywhere in the above code, go ahead an try to add the following code:

``` C++
printf("beyond the pale %d\n", values[5]);
```

Re-run the program and see what you get.

On my implementation, I saw the following:

``` Prompt
beyond the pale 32765
```

You may see that, or you may (most likely) see a different value. That's because we've run off the end of the array and are in ... well ... undefined space. It's entirely possible that the memory after the 5th element in the array is something else entirely.

Running off the end of an array is a common bug in programming.

## More Array Types

What we've seen so far is a 1 dimensional, or linear, array.  We can also define a 2D array. It folows a similar syntax:

`int array2D[2][6];`

You can also create a 3D array:

`int array3D[2][6][7];`

And a 4D array:

`int array4D[2][6][7][10];`

And so on ... but you won't ever do that (I hope).

What does a program that uses a 2D array look like?

``` C++
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // Set up a 5x7 rectangular grid
    int Grid[5][7];

    // Set up a 10x10 square grid
    float Weights[10][10];

    // initialize the Grid to 0
    for (int a = 0; a < 5; a++)
    {
        for (int b = 0; b < 5; b++)
        {
            Grid[a][b] = 0;
        }
    }

    // Initialize the Weights to 0.0f
    for (int a = 0; a < 10; a++)
    {
        for (int b = 0; b < 10; b++)
        {
            Weights[a][b] = 0.0f;
        }
    }

    // Set some random values
    Grid[2][2] = 9;
    Grid[4][1] = 3;
    Grid[3][4] = 1;

    Weights[0][0] = 5;
    Weights[9][7] = 2;
    Weights[4][5] = 7;
    Weights[7][7] = 3;
    Weights[2][2] = 5;
    Weights[6][4] = 1;
    Weights[0][5] = 8;

    // and draw the arrays
    printf("Grid ----------------\n");
    for (int a = 0; a < 5; a++)
    {
        for (int b = 0; b < 5; b++)
        {
            printf("[%d]",Grid[a][b]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    printf("\nWeights\n");
    for (int a = 0; a < 10; a++)
    {
        for (int b = 0; b < 10; b++)
        {
            printf("[%2.2f]", Weights[a][b]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

}
```

And the results:

``` Prompt
gcc version 4.6.3

Grid ----------------

I'll talk more about Arrays in a while, but for now, I think that's a pretty decent description of them.

## A little bit of graphics

We're going to talk about graphics, because I think this will help make learning C/C++ a lot more fun.  I've always found it really, really cool to talk about graphics and all the weirdness that goes with it. So, if you'll indulge me, I'll begin to 'wax nostalgic'.

The ability to create motion on a computer screen, or TV, or in a movie is based on a property of the eye called 'Persistence of vision'. It's actually an optical illusion where a bunch of still images, played back sequenctially at a high rate, give the illusion of motion.

![running horse](images/running-horse.gif)

To have a better illusion of motion, you need to be able to display images at a faster rate than what you see in the above gif. To do this monitors draw an image on the screen at a certaion 'refresh rate'; the time between 'frames' of an image. A monitor that displays 60 frames per second (or a refresh rate of 60 Hz) will take 16.67 milliseconds to draw a frame. A 120 Hz monitor will take 8.33 milliseconds per frame. And so on. That means you have to do a lot of work, computationally, in a shorter period of time as framerates increase.

What makes up an image, then? Let's take as an example a low resolution picture of our family doggo, Leika:

![Leika](images/leika720.png)

That image is 720 _pixels_ wide by 540 _pixels_ tall. A pixel is the smalles 'picture element' you have on a monitor/tv/raster output device. So you can consider that image to be an array of 720x540 pixels. If we zoom in on that image, we start to see the pixels:

![Leika pixelated](images/leika_pixelated.png)

Each pixel can have a colour value. And how we store that color is ... interesting.

Each pixel in that image takes up a byte for a Red, Green, Blue and Alpha channel. That's 4 bytes per pixel worth of storage (or 32 bits per pixel - BPP for short). From an earlier article, we said that a byte can represent a value from 0 - 255, that means that we can have 256 discrete 'levels' of red, green, blue and alpha per pixel, or 16.7 million color variations - without including any transparency.  That's a lot of colours. It's also a lot of memory.

`720 x 540 x 8 bytes = 3,110,400 bytes (a little over 3 megabytes).`

That's what makes up an image, and that same principle applies to rendering graphics to a computer monitor, or an application window. The Allegro library that we use just makes that a lot easier for us to work with drawing content into the window.

## The New Project

I made a gif to help with showing how to set up the new project, using the project template I talked about in the [First Steps article](02.firststeps.md).

![Setting Up a new project](images/windowlayoutproject.gif)

We do still have to set the project as the startup project, otherwise when we try and run the project, we won't actually be running our new project:

![Set the Startup Project](images/setstartupproject.gif)

If you run that project, you get the same results as in the first steps article.

![running the sample](images/initialtemplate.gif)


## Changing the default project behaviour

Let's draw dots, in different colours on the corners of the screen, to get an idea as to what the co-ordinate space looks like:

``` C++
int main()
{
	Setup();

	while (true)
	{
		ALLEGRO_EVENT event;
		ALLEGRO_TIMEOUT timeout;
		al_init_timeout(&timeout, 0.06);

		bool get_event = al_wait_for_event_until(gEventQueue, &event, &timeout);

		if (get_event && event.type == ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_CLOSE)
		{
			break;
		}

		al_put_pixel(0, 0, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 255));
		al_put_pixel(0, 1, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 255));
		al_put_pixel(0, 2, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 255));
		al_put_pixel(1, 0, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 255));
		al_put_pixel(1, 1, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 255));
		al_put_pixel(1, 2, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 255));
		al_put_pixel(2, 0, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 255));
		al_put_pixel(2, 1, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 255));
		al_put_pixel(2, 2, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 255));

		al_put_pixel(797, 0, al_map_rgb(0, 255, 0));
		al_put_pixel(797, 1, al_map_rgb(0, 255, 0));
		al_put_pixel(797, 2, al_map_rgb(0, 255, 0));
		al_put_pixel(798, 0, al_map_rgb(0, 255, 0));
		al_put_pixel(798, 1, al_map_rgb(0, 255, 0));
		al_put_pixel(798, 2, al_map_rgb(0, 255, 0));
		al_put_pixel(799, 0, al_map_rgb(0, 255, 0));
		al_put_pixel(799, 1, al_map_rgb(0, 255, 0));
		al_put_pixel(799, 2, al_map_rgb(0, 255, 0));

		al_put_pixel(0, 597, al_map_rgb(255, 0, 0));
		al_put_pixel(0, 598, al_map_rgb(255, 0, 0));
		al_put_pixel(0, 599, al_map_rgb(255, 0, 0));
		al_put_pixel(1, 597, al_map_rgb(255, 0, 0));
		al_put_pixel(1, 598, al_map_rgb(255, 0, 0));
		al_put_pixel(1, 599, al_map_rgb(255, 0, 0));
		al_put_pixel(2, 597, al_map_rgb(255, 0, 0));
		al_put_pixel(2, 598, al_map_rgb(255, 0, 0));
		al_put_pixel(2, 599, al_map_rgb(255, 0, 0));

		al_put_pixel(797, 597, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 0));
		al_put_pixel(797, 598, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 0));
		al_put_pixel(797, 599, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 0));
		al_put_pixel(798, 597, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 0));
		al_put_pixel(798, 598, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 0));
		al_put_pixel(798, 599, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 0));
		al_put_pixel(799, 597, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 0));
		al_put_pixel(799, 598, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 0));
		al_put_pixel(799, 599, al_map_rgb(255, 255, 0));

		al_flip_display();
	}

	return 0;
}
```

When we run this program, we now get:

![modified running program](images/screenpixellocations.png)

The window, by default, is set to 800x600. And the extents of the area we can draw to is 0-799 along the X-Axis and 0-599 along the Y axis.If we resize the screen to 1024x768:

![resized screen](images/screenpixellocationsresized.png)

You can see that the coloured squares don't move.

We have now successfuly drawn a grouping of pixels onto the screen! Why don't we try moving them around?

## Animated Pixels

Let's do that. Here's some code to review:

``` C++
// spacedinvaders.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console application.
//

#include "stdafx.h"

#include <stdio.h>
#include <allegro5/allegro.h>
#include <allegro5/allegro_image.h>
#include <allegro5/allegro_primitives.h>
#include <allegro5/allegro_font.h>

// Forward Declarations
void Setup();
void Teardown();

// Global definitions
ALLEGRO_DISPLAY* gDisplay = nullptr;
ALLEGRO_FONT* gFont = nullptr;
ALLEGRO_EVENT_QUEUE* gEventQueue = nullptr;

struct Colour
{
	int R;
	int G;
	int B;
};

struct Pixel
{
	int X;
	int Y;
	Colour ElementColour;
};

void DrawPixel(Pixel* pixel, int deltaX, int deltaY)
{
	pixel->X += deltaX;
	pixel->Y += deltaY;

	int x = pixel->X;
	int y = pixel->Y;
	ALLEGRO_COLOR drawcolor = al_map_rgb(pixel->ElementColour.R, pixel->ElementColour.G, pixel->ElementColour.B);
	al_put_pixel(x, y, drawcolor);
	al_put_pixel(x, y + 1, drawcolor);
	al_put_pixel(x, y + 2, drawcolor);
	al_put_pixel(x + 1, y, drawcolor);
	al_put_pixel(x + 1, y + 1, drawcolor);
	al_put_pixel(x + 1, y + 2, drawcolor);
	al_put_pixel(x + 2, y, drawcolor);
	al_put_pixel(x + 2, y + 1, drawcolor);
	al_put_pixel(x + 2, y + 2, drawcolor);
}

int main()
{
	Setup();

	Pixel pixelsToDraw[4];

	for (int index = 0; index < 4; index++)
	{
		pixelsToDraw[index].X = 400;
		pixelsToDraw[index].Y = 300;
		pixelsToDraw[index].ElementColour.R = rand() % 255;
		pixelsToDraw[index].ElementColour.G = rand() % 255;
		pixelsToDraw[index].ElementColour.B = rand() % 255;
	}

	while (true)
	{
		ALLEGRO_EVENT event;
		ALLEGRO_TIMEOUT timeout;
		al_init_timeout(&timeout, 0.06);

		bool get_event = al_wait_for_event_until(gEventQueue, &event, &timeout);

		if (get_event && event.type == ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_CLOSE)
		{
			break;
		}

		for (int index = 0; index < 4; index++)
		{
			int deltaX = (rand() % 8) - 4;
			int deltaY = (rand() % 8) - 4;

			DrawPixel(&pixelsToDraw[index], deltaX, deltaY);
		}
		al_flip_display();
	}

	return 0;
}

// Cut for brevity
```

And we get:

![Animated Pixels](images/animatedpixels01.gif)

### The Breakdown

We've added into the templated code:

- two new structs - `Colour` and `Pixel`
- a new function called `DrawPixel`
- a heavily updated `main` function

If you take a look at the `Pixel` struct, you can also see that it contains an instance of the `Colour` struct. That's perfectly legal. You can access the contents of that struct with the `.` operator as well.

Let's look that the `main` function first, before we dig into the `DrawPixel` function.

`Pixel pixelsToDraw[4];`

That's creating an 4 element array called `pixelsToDraw`.

``` C++
for (int index = 0; index < 4; index++)
{
    pixelsToDraw[index].X = 400;
    pixelsToDraw[index].Y = 300;
    pixelsToDraw[index].ElementColour.R = rand() % 255;
    pixelsToDraw[index].ElementColour.G = rand() % 255;
    pixelsToDraw[index].ElementColour.B = rand() % 255;
}
```

This iterates over the 4 elements in the array, setting the position to be the middle of the screen and then initializing the colour to a random value.

We then get into the main `while` loop and we do our normal bookkeeping (set the timeout, event and breakout code).

Then we draw the pixels on screen:

``` C++
for (int index = 0; index < 4; index++)
{
    int deltaX = (rand() % 8) - 4;
    int deltaY = (rand() % 8) - 4;

    DrawPixel(&pixelsToDraw[index], deltaX, deltaY);
}
al_flip_display();
```

I want the direction to be positive or negative (so that it can spiral out). `rand() % 8` will give us a range between [0 - 7]. Subtracting 4 from that gives us a range of [-4 - 3].

Calling our `DrawPixel` function, we pass in, as the first arguement, the address of the array element (`&pixelsToDraw[index]`) as well as the delta X and Y. We pass it in as a pointer as I want to have the DrawPixel function update the position of the drawn pixel.

- Note: this is actually a bad thing to do, in terms of programming. Not because we're modifying a value, that's totally cool. But because we're editing a value _and_ drawing the pixel. The goal of a function is to do one thing, and one thing well. Modifying a value and then drawing it breaks this rule. However, I wanted to illustrate modifying an array element. In the future, I will strive to follow this rule in all examples. I may also modify this example in the future to follow this rule.

Since we call `DrawPixel`, we should see what it does. Let's look at it in detail:

``` C++
void DrawPixel(Pixel* pixel, int deltaX, int deltaY)
{
	pixel->X += deltaX;
	pixel->Y += deltaY;

	int x = pixel->X;
	int y = pixel->Y;
	ALLEGRO_COLOR drawcolor = al_map_rgb(pixel->ElementColour.R, pixel->ElementColour.G, pixel->ElementColour.B);
	al_put_pixel(x, y, drawcolor);
	al_put_pixel(x, y + 1, drawcolor);
	al_put_pixel(x, y + 2, drawcolor);
	al_put_pixel(x + 1, y, drawcolor);
	al_put_pixel(x + 1, y + 1, drawcolor);
	al_put_pixel(x + 1, y + 2, drawcolor);
	al_put_pixel(x + 2, y, drawcolor);
	al_put_pixel(x + 2, y + 1, drawcolor);
	al_put_pixel(x + 2, y + 2, drawcolor);
}
```

The function signature should be understandable at this point - we have a pointer to a `Pixel` structure and two integers for a delta X and Y.

And then we have `pixel->X += deltaX;` and it's pair `pixel->Y += deltaY`. Looks like we have two new operators: `->` and `+=`.

If you remember from before, you can access fields in a struct with a `.` operator. But we've passed in a pointer to a `Pixel` structure here. To make it into a `Pixel` structure, you'd have to de-reference it, like so: `(*pixel).X` and `(*pixel).Y`. The `->` operator is essentially shorthand for dereferencing that pointer.

That leaves the `+=` operator. There's also a `-=`, `*=` and `\=` operator. These are called 'Compound Operators'; they modify the variable on the left hand side of the operator by the operation to the left of the `=` sign. In essence, it too is shorthand, for something like this:

``` C++
int a = 5;

a = a + 2;  // These two lines ...
a += 2;     // are functionally the same
```

## The output, in review

Take a look at the output from this program.

![Animated Pixels](images/animatedpixels01.gif)

That's animating ... but not really. Notice that there is a trail left on the pixles as they move. That's because we never clear the screen.

Why do we need to clear the screen?  Think about how you do flip-book animation, or any traditional, cell based animation - for each frame, we start with a fresh sheet of paper. We're not doing that in our example, we just keep adding to the paper; we don't change the page when we draw.

To do that in computer graphics, we perform a 'clear-screen' with a specific colour. In this case, we would use black. And we would clear the screen at the beginning of every frame of animation.

The code we would add looks like this:

`al_clear_to_color(al_map_rgb(0, 0, 0));`

And we would add it right after our while `for` in our `main` function.

``` C++
al_clear_to_color(al_map_rgb(0, 0, 0)); // This is the line we'd add

for (int index = 0; index < 4; index++)
{
	int deltaX = (rand() % 8) - 4;
	int deltaY = (rand() % 8) - 4;

	DrawPixel(&pixelsToDraw[index], deltaX, deltaY);
}
al_flip_display();
```

With this modification, you should see the folowing output:

![Animated Pixels](images/animatedpixels02.gif)

Lo and behold, you now have your first animation! It's nothing fancy, it's a bunch of dots moving around.

But it's the start of graphics programming. Think of it like this, you are now at the Atari 2600 level of graphics programming. Go us!

# Wrap-up

That's a fair bit covered in this article. But it's a lot of good ground. In our next article, we'll talk more about graphics and animation.

Until next time!
