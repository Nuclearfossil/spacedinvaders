# More With Functions

In the last article, we started using functions that were provided by a library - `stdio.h`. In this article, we're going to create our own functions, and see what it takes to make a program that does something practical.

## Previously ...

In my first article, I showed you some assembly code. It looked like this:

``` asm
  push rbp
  mov rbp, rsp
  movss xmm0, DWORD PTR .LC0[rip]
  pop rbp
  ret
.LC0:
  .long 1078523331
```

That example is incredibly hard to read, let alone write. Especially considering all that program does is give us a rough approximation of Pi: `3.14`.

Here's what that code actually looks like, in C, as a _function_:

``` C++
// Return a constant representing the value of Pi
float calcPi()
{
    return 3.14f;
}
```

We've talked about functions before, when talking about `main` and `printf`. But this is _our_ code now. This actually does something we have control over. So let's break it down; this should be a bit of a review as well.

The first line in the example is a 'comment'. Remember, comments never actually get put into our program. It's only there to help us remember what we were doing, or to communicate our thoughts to others.

Next, we declare a function called `calcPi`. The function `calcPi` then has a body that actually does the work of this function. It's a good design strategy when writing functions that they only do *one* thing, and one thing well. Let's break the 'function signature' down:

| Function Return Value | Function Name | Function Arguments |
| ---------------------:|:-------------:| ------------------ |
| float                 | calcPi        | () |

That function signature states that for the function `calcPi` it returns a floating point value and takes no parameters.

`float` and `return` are C _keywords_. Keywords are predefined words in the C++ language that have special meanings. They help define the language _syntax_; those rules that define a set of rules that define the combination of symbols and keywords that are considered to be a correctly formatted and gramatically correct program. What we're doing is defining the syntax of our function using these keywords.

To continue, a `float` is what's called a 'data type' (also referred to as just a 'type'). It defines the rules that the data must follow. For example, a float is a real number that can have a negative or a positive sign, a whole part and a decimal part.

<pre>
     sign whole decimal
        +     3.1415926
</pre>

However, a float cannot be a string; you can't use `"My dog is beautiful"` as a floating point number.

There are a number of data types defined by the C/C++ language and I'll introduce them as we go. Once we have a few under our belt, I'll list out all the inherent data types.

The `return` part of the body of the function is directly related to that `float` in the 'function signature'.  Thus the `return` keyword will return back to whatever called this function a value, in this case `3.14 ... f`.

Using an `f` at the end of that number tells C/C++ that the _constant_ value of `3.14` is a floating point number; It's the right data for a return value that should be a `float`.

## Another example

The `calcPi` function has a return value. But what if I wanted to have the function work on something. For example,let's say I wanted to double a given floating point number? Then I would need to pass in some arguements into the function:

``` C++
float multBy2(float value)
{
    return value * 2.0f;
}
```

The _syntax_ of this function should look similar to the previous example, but with one exception - in between the round brackets (parenthesis) we have `float value`. This is the 'arguement' of the function.

| Function Return Value | Function Name | Function Arguments |
| ---------------------:|:-------------:| ------------------ |
| float | multBy2 | (float value) |

We've seen the `float` keyword already - it defines a data type, but now we have this additional word, `value`. This is what's called a 'variable name' (or just 'variable'). Much like in math, thinking to your linear algebra classes, a variable does not have a fixed, or constant value.

In the case of the `multBy2` function, it returns a `float` but also takes in a single `float` as it's arguement. Functions can have many arguments; you separate each argument with a comma (`,`) and describe the data tye as well as a unique variable name.

It then takes that variable and multiplies it by 2 (`2.0f` in this case). And then returns it to whatever called this function.

A lot to unpack in just that one line of code. Let's start:

1. C++ defines core mathematical operations as such: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `(`, `)`. These are called 'operators'. In order, that's Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Parenthesis.
2. Mathematical order of operations is grouped first by parenthesis, then multiplication and division, and finally addition/subtraction. There *is no inherent order of operations* defined in C++; it's not like prefix or postfix math. Any order of operations is inherently defined by the operator iteself. For example, the `+` operator processes from left to right. Source: [cppreference](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/eval_order)
3. The `return` keyword will evaluate everything to it's right before returning. Thus we can assume that everything to the right will get computed. However, if you want to resolve any ambiguity, you can place parenthesis around the operations: `return (value * 2.0f);`. This is purely for asthetics as it does nothing to the compiled code. (There is one exception, but I'm not going to cover it here as it's a fairly advanced issue).

How do we invoke a function? Glad you asked. Invoking `multBy2` would look like this:

``` C++
float result = multBy2(7.0f);
```

After that line is executed, we would have a new variable, `result` that would contain a floating point value of `14.0f`.

How would we use that for real? I mean, the entire point of this article is to see a program in action!  We're going to use a web app called [C++ shell](http://cpp.sh/) to muck around with coding.

I've placed all of the above code into a program [here](https://repl.it/@Nuclearfossil/OurOwnFunctions) (As well as a backup [here](http://cpp.sh/42me)).

``` C++
// Example program
#include <stdio.h>

float calcPi()
{
    return 3.14f;
}

float multBy2(float value)
{
    return value * 2.0f;
}

int main()
{
    float doubled7 = multBy2(7.0f);
    float pi = calcPi();

    printf("variable: doubled7: %f\n", doubled7);
    printf("variable: pi: %f\n", pi);
}
```

Let's break down the `main` function line by line:

``` C++
    float doubled7 = multBy2(7.0f);
```

On this line we create a new variable `doubled7` and initialize it with the output of the function `multBy2`. From this point onward, in the main function, we will be able to access the variable `doubled7`. We could not have used `doubled7` before that line!

``` C++
    float pi = calcPi();
```

This is the fundamentally the same as the previous line. We create a new variable `pi` that is generated by the funtion `calcPi`.

``` C++
    printf("variable: doubled7: %f\n", doubled7);
```

Remember, `printf` is a function that we haven't defined ourself. It's part of a library. We reference that library with an `#include` directive, which is done on the first line:

``` C++
#include <stdio.h>
```

As you can see, the `printf` function takes more than one arguement. In the earlier articles, we didn't use any additional arguements! Is that legal?  It is, for the `printf` function, because of the way it was declared. We won't go into that now, but it would be worth covering in a future article, if there's interest.

We kind of glossed over what `printf` does. But we should be crystal clear on how it actually is intended to work The `printf` function prints a formatted string to the console (`printf` actually stands for '*print f*ormatted'. There are a set of formatting specifiers that you can encode into the string that will allow you to do in-place substitution of the value of a variable into the string. We've seen this previously with the `\n` escape character, but now we're seeing some additional formatting specifiers. In this case, using a `%` symbol in the formatting string indicates that we are going to replace what follows with the next arguement in the call to `printf`. The `f` character that follows the `%` tells `printf` to expect a `float` variable.

When the example program runs, we have the output string that looks like this:
`variable: doubled7: 14.000000`

What else can we do with formatting specifiers? Well, we can shorten the length of that float (to 2 decimal places), enforce numbers to have a +/- sign, numerical padding (adding 0's to the left of the whole number part of a float) as well as a bunch of other things.

``` C++
    printf("variable: pi: %f\n", pi);
```

I think you can see what this is doing.

### Output

When you actually execute the code, you end up with the following output:

``` bash
variable: doubled7: 14.000000
variable: pi: 3.140000
```

# Summary

We've now seen more details on creating your own functions. We've really only scratched the surface there and we'll return to it later. In our next article, we're going to cover some very important concepts - program flow control.

Stay tuned!
