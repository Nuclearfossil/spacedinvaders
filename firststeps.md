# Your first real program

## Summary

In this article, we move from web-based C++ tools, to something you can run on your own machine, using Visual Studio 2017.

In order to help speed up your ability to work with the codebase, I've created a Visual Studio 2017 project template you can work with. It's located in the `templates` folder in this repo. It's called `SpacedInvadersTemplate.zip`.

In order to use it, you'll need to copy it into your `Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Templates\ProjectTemplates` folder. If you have Visual Studio already running, you'll need to restart the IDE (not your computer).

From that point on, if you want to create a new project to work from, all you have to do is select the template and it will automatically create a starter project for you:
